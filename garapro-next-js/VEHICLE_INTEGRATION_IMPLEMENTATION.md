# Vehicle Integration Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of vehicle management integration in the repair order creation workflow. The integration allows managers to select a customer, view their associated vehicles, and either select an existing vehicle or add a new one before proceeding with repair order creation.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Data Models

Created new TypeScript interfaces in `src/types/manager/vehicle.ts`:

- `VehicleDto`: Represents a vehicle with all its properties
- `RoBoardCustomerDto`: Represents customer information in the context of vehicle management
- `VehicleWithCustomerDto`: Combines vehicle and customer information
- `CreateVehicleDto`: DTO for creating new vehicles

### 2. API Service

Created `src/services/manager/vehicle-service.ts` with the following methods:

1. `getVehiclesByCustomerId(userId: string)`: Fetches all vehicles for a specific customer
2. `getVehicleById(vehicleId: string)`: Retrieves details of a specific vehicle
3. `createVehicle(vehicleData: CreateVehicleDto)`: Creates a new vehicle

### 3. UI Components

#### CreateTask Component (`src/app/manager/repairOrderManagement/components/create-task.tsx`)

Updated to include vehicle management functionality:

- Added state for vehicle options and loading states
- Implemented `fetchVehiclesForCustomer` to load vehicles when a customer is selected
- Updated vehicle selection dropdown to display vehicles for the selected customer
- Modified `handleAddVehicle` to integrate with the new vehicle service
- Added loading indicators for vehicle fetching

#### AddVehicleDialog Component (`src/app/manager/repairOrderManagement/components/add-vehicle-dialog.tsx`)

Updated to work with the new vehicle service:

- Simplified form fields to match available API properties
- Added proper validation for required fields
- Removed unused imports

### 4. Workflow

1. **Customer Selection**: User searches and selects a customer
2. **Vehicle Loading**: System automatically fetches vehicles associated with the selected customer
3. **Vehicle Selection**: User can either:
   - Select an existing vehicle from the dropdown
   - Click "ADD NEW VEHICLE" to open the vehicle creation dialog
4. **Vehicle Creation**: When adding a new vehicle:
   - User fills in vehicle details
   - System associates the vehicle with the selected customer
   - New vehicle is added to the vehicle options and automatically selected
5. **Repair Order Creation**: Once both customer and vehicle are selected, user can proceed with creating the repair order

## API Endpoints Used

1. `GET /api/VehicleIntegration/customer/{userId}/vehicles` - Get all vehicles for a customer
2. `GET /api/VehicleIntegration/vehicle/{vehicleId}` - Get specific vehicle details
3. `POST /api/Vehicles` - Create a new vehicle

## Key Features

- **Automatic Vehicle Loading**: Vehicles are automatically loaded when a customer is selected
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators for both customer search and vehicle loading
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Validation**: Form validation for both customer and vehicle creation
- **Auto-selection**: New vehicles are automatically selected after creation
- **Responsive UI**: Loading states and disabled controls during API operations

## Files Modified/Created

1. `src/types/manager/vehicle.ts` - New file with vehicle type definitions
2. `src/services/manager/vehicle-service.ts` - New file with vehicle API service
3. `src/app/manager/repairOrderManagement/components/create-task.tsx` - Updated component with vehicle integration
4. `src/app/manager/repairOrderManagement/components/add-vehicle-dialog.tsx` - Updated dialog with simplified form

## Future Improvements

1. **Brand/Model/Color Selection**: Implement dropdowns for brand, model, and color selection instead of text inputs
2. **VIN Validation**: Add validation for VIN format
3. **Odometer Tracking**: Include odometer input for service history tracking
4. **Vehicle Images**: Add support for vehicle images
5. **Enhanced Search**: Implement vehicle search by license plate, VIN, or other criteria
