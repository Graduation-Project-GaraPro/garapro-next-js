## Implementation Details

### Customer Selection Workflow

1. User searches for a customer or creates a new one
2. When a customer is selected (either by search or creation):
   - Customer details appear in a green highlighted box
   - Vehicle selection becomes enabled
   - "ADD NEW VEHICLE" button becomes enabled
3. User can change customer selection using the "Change" button
4. Changing customer clears vehicle selection

### Vehicle Selection Workflow

1. Vehicle selection is disabled until customer is selected
2. User can select an existing vehicle or add a new one
3. When a vehicle is selected:
   - Vehicle details appear in a green highlighted box
4. User can change vehicle selection using the "Change" button
5. Changing customer clears vehicle selection

### Validation and Error Handling

1. Customer creation form validates:
   - Name is required
   - Phone is required
   - Email format (if provided)
2. Error messages are displayed as red toast notifications
3. Success messages are displayed as green toast notifications
4. API errors are handled gracefully with user-friendly messages

## User Experience Improvements

### Visual Feedback
- Selected items are clearly highlighted in green
- Disabled states are visually distinct
- Change buttons provide clear action paths
- Loading states show "Searching..." or "Adding..." indicators

### Workflow Guidance

- Change functionality allows easy correction
- Visual indicators show current selection state

### Error Prevention
- Input validation prevents common mistakes
- Clear error messages guide users to corrections
- Disabled states prevent invalid actions
- Success confirmations provide positive feedback
