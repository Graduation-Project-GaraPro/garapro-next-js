# Repair Order Creation Fix Summary

## Problem
The repair order creation was failing with a NETWORK_ERROR (status 0) when trying to create a new repair order. The issue was that the frontend was sending too many fields in the request body that were actually auto-generated by the backend.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. The [CreateRepairOrderRequest](file:///d:/GraduationProject/FE/garapro-next-js/garapro-next-js/src/types/manager/repair-order.ts#L27-L35) interface was incorrectly defined with many fields that should be auto-generated by the backend
2. The frontend was trying to send all these fields, causing the backend to reject the request
3. The working curl request showed that only 8 specific fields were needed

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed CreateRepairOrderRequest Interface
**File:** [src/types/manager/repair-order.ts](file:///d:/GraduationProject/FE/garapro-next-js/garapro-next-js/src/types/manager/repair-order.ts)

**Before:**
```typescript
export interface CreateRepairOrderRequest {
  receiveDate: string
  roType: number
  estimatedCompletionDate: string | null
  completionDate: string | null
  cost: number
  estimatedAmount: number
  paidAmount: number
  paidStatus: string
  estimatedRepairTime: number
  note: string
  isArchived: boolean
  branchId: string
  statusId: string
  vehicleId: string
  userId: string
  repairRequestId: string
  customerName: string
  customerPhone: string
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
export interface CreateRepairOrderRequest {
  customerId: string
  vehicleId: string
  receiveDate: string
  roType: number
  estimatedCompletionDate: string
  estimatedAmount: number
  note: string
  estimatedRepairTime: number
}
```

### 2. Updated RO Board Page
**File:** [src/app/manager/repairOrderManagement/ro-board/page.tsx](file:///d:/GraduationProject/FE/garapro-next-js/garapro-next-js/src/app/manager/repairOrderManagement/ro-board/page.tsx)

- Added missing imports for types and components
- Fixed the [handleCreateRepairOrderWrapper](file:///d:/GraduationProject/FE/garapro-next-js/garapro-next-js/src/app/manager/repairOrderManagement/ro-board/page.tsx#L83-L141) function to properly type the request object
- Ensured only the required fields are sent in the request

### 3. Updated CreateTask Component
**File:** [src/app/manager/repairOrderManagement/components/create-task.tsx](file:///d:/GraduationProject/FE/garapro-next-js/garapro-next-js/src/app/manager/repairOrderManagement/components/create-task.tsx)

- Fixed the [handleSubmit](file:///d:/GraduationProject/FE/garapro-next-js/garapro-next-js/src/app/manager/repairOrderManagement/components/create-task.tsx#L172-L207) function to include all required Job fields
- Ensured the data structure matches what the backend expects

## Verification
The fix has been implemented and tested. The repair order creation now works correctly by:

1. Sending only the 8 required fields from the frontend
2. Letting the backend auto-generate the remaining fields
3. Properly handling the response from the backend

## Working Request Format
The frontend now sends a request with this structure:
```json
{
  "customerId": "string",
  "vehicleId": "string",
  "receiveDate": "2025-10-21T09:43:59.848Z",
  "roType": 0,
  "estimatedCompletionDate": "2025-10-24T09:43:59.848Z",
  "estimatedAmount": 5000000,
  "note": "k no may",
  "estimatedRepairTime": 30
}
```

This matches exactly what the working curl request was sending, which resolved the NETWORK_ERROR issue.
