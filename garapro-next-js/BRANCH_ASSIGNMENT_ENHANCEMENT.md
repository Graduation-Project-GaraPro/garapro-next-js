# Branch Assignment Enhancement

## Overview

This enhancement improves the repair order creation process by assigning the correct branch ID based on the currently logged-in manager's assignment rather than using a default or first available branch.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Current User Identification

The system now retrieves the currently logged-in user's ID using the authService:
```typescript
const currentUser = authService.getCurrentUser();
const currentUserId = currentUser.userId;
```

### 2. Branch Assignment Logic

The enhanced logic for determining the branch ID:
1. Get the current user's ID
2. Fetch all active branches
3. Find the branch where the managerId matches the current user's ID
4. If found, use that branch ID
5. If not found, fall back to the first available branch
6. If no branches are available, use the default branch ID from API responses

### 3. Benefits

This approach provides several benefits:
- **Correct Branch Assignment**: Repair orders are associated with the manager's actual branch
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Graceful degradation when user-to-branch mapping fails
- **Default Values**: Uses real API data as defaults instead of placeholder values
- **Better User Experience**: Managers see repair orders for their own branch

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/manager/repairOrderManagement/ro-board/page.tsx` - Enhanced branch assignment logic

## Testing

To verify the enhancement:
1. Log in as a manager
2. Navigate to the repair order creation page
3. Create a new repair order
4. Verify that the branch ID in the created repair order matches the manager's assigned branch

## Future Improvements

1. Implement a more sophisticated branch selection mechanism for managers who oversee multiple branches
2. Add UI elements to allow managers to select which branch they're working with
3. Implement caching for branch information to reduce API calls
4. Add error handling for cases where a manager is not assigned to any branch
