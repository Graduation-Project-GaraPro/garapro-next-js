# SignalR Error Fix Documentation

## Problem
The SignalR connection was failing with the error:
```
Error: Failed to invoke 'Connected' due to an error on the server. HubException: Method does not exist.
```

## Root Cause
The client was trying to invoke a "Connected" method on the server hub, but that method doesn't exist on the server side. The problematic code was:

```typescript
// Notify successful connection
this.invokeClientMethod("Connected", this.connection.connectionId || "");
```

## Solution
Removed the attempt to invoke a non-existent "Connected" method on the server. The server will automatically send events to the client when appropriate.

### Changes Made
1. Removed the `this.invokeClientMethod("Connected", ...)` call from the `initialize()` method
2. Added a comment explaining that the server automatically sends events
3. Kept the client-side event listener for "Connected" events (in case the server does send them)

## How SignalR Works in This Application

### Client-Side Event Listeners
The client registers listeners for these events:
- `RepairOrderMoved` - When a repair order is moved to a different status
- `RepairOrderCreated` - When a new repair order is created
- `RepairOrderUpdated` - When an existing repair order is updated
- `RepairOrderDeleted` - When a repair order is deleted
- `Connected` - When the client successfully connects (if the server sends this event)

### Server-Side Events
The server automatically broadcasts events to all connected clients:
- When a repair order is moved, created, updated, or deleted
- The server handles the event distribution - clients don't need to invoke server methods for these

### API Integration
For drag and drop operations, the client:
1. Calls the REST API endpoint `/api/RepairOrder/status/update`
2. The server processes the request and updates the database
3. The server automatically broadcasts a `RepairOrderMoved` event to all clients
4. All clients update their UI based on the received event

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Navigate to the repair order board
2. Check the browser console for SignalR connection messages
3. Verify that drag and drop operations work without errors
4. Confirm that real-time updates are received when other users make changes

## Verification

The fix can be verified by:
1. No more "Method does not exist" errors in the console
2. Successful SignalR connection
3. Proper real-time updates when repair orders are modified
4. Working drag and drop functionality
