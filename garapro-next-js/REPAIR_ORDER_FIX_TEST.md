# Repair Order Creation Fix Verification

## Issue Summary
The repair order creation was failing with a NETWORK_ERROR (status 0) because the frontend was sending too many fields in the request body that were actually auto-generated by the backend.

## Root Cause
The [CreateRepairOrderRequest](file:///d:/GraduationProject/FE/garapro-next-js/garapro-next-js/src/types/manager/repair-order.ts#L27-L35) interface in [src/types/manager/repair-order.ts](file:///d:/GraduationProject/FE/garapro-next-js/garapro-next-js/src/types/manager/repair-order.ts) was incorrectly defined with many fields that should be auto-generated by the backend, including:
- completionDate
- cost
- paidAmount
- paidStatus
- isArchived
- branchId
- statusId
- userId
- repairRequestId
- customerName
- customerPhone

## Solution Implemented
1. **Fixed the CreateRepairOrderRequest interface** to only include the fields that should be sent from the frontend:
   - customerId
   - vehicleId
   - receiveDate
   - roType
   - estimatedCompletionDate
   - estimatedAmount
   - note
   - estimatedRepairTime

2. **Updated the handleCreateRepairOrderWrapper function** in [src/app/manager/repairOrderManagement/ro-board/page.tsx](file:///d:/GraduationProject/FE/garapro-next-js/garapro-next-js/src/app/manager/repairOrderManagement/ro-board/page.tsx) to properly type the request object and only send the required fields.

3. **Added missing imports** to fix TypeScript errors.

## Testing Instructions
1. Start the application: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the Repair Order Board
3. Click "Create Repair Order"
4. Select a customer
5. Select a vehicle
6. Fill in the required information
7. Click "Create Repair Order"
8. Check the browser console for successful creation logs

## Expected Working curl Request Format
```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://localhost:7113/api/RepairOrder' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "customerId": "ad9e0c46-8edc-48d7-9e01-b312f9a27872",
  "vehicleId": "7D6A3D38-20A5-441C-A52C-88BF41984311",
  "receiveDate": "2025-10-21T09:43:59.848Z",
  "roType": 0,
  "estimatedCompletionDate": "2025-10-24T09:43:59.848Z",
  "estimatedAmount": 5000000,
  "note": "k no may",
  "estimatedRepairTime": 30
}'
```

## Verification
- The repair order should be created successfully without a NETWORK_ERROR
- The response should include all the auto-generated fields from the backend
- The repair order should appear in the board/list view
