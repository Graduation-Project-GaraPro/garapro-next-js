# Fixed Duplicate Toast Messages and Auto-Selection Issues

## Issues Identified

1. **Duplicate Toast Messages**: When creating a new customer, two toast messages were appearing:
   - One showing "Customer 'undefined undefined' created successfully"
   - Another showing the correct customer name

2. **Auto-Selection Not Working**: Newly created customers were not being automatically selected.

3. **Undefined Names**: Customer names were displaying as "undefined undefined" in some cases.

## Root Causes

1. The duplicate toast issue was likely caused by having toast messages in both the AddCustomerDialog component and the CreateTask component.

2. The auto-selection issue was due to improper handling of customer names that could result in empty or undefined values.

3. The undefined names issue was caused by not properly handling cases where firstName or lastName might be empty or undefined.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Customer Name Handling in CreateTask Component

Updated the [handleAddCustomer](file:///d:/GraduationProject/FE/garapro-next-js/garapro-next-js/src/app/manager/repairOrderManagement/components/create-task.tsx#L188-L233) function in [create-task.tsx](file:///d:/GraduationProject/FE/garapro-next-js/garapro-next-js/src/app/manager/repairOrderManagement/components/create-task.tsx) to:

- Provide a fallback name "Unknown Customer" when customer names are empty
- Ensure proper auto-selection of newly created customers
- Use the actual customer name for the toast message instead of potentially undefined values

### 2. Enhanced Customer Name Handling in Search Function

Updated the [searchCustomersFromApi](file:///d:/GraduationProject/FE/garapro-next-js/garapro-next-js/src/app/manager/repairOrderManagement/components/create-task.tsx#L86-L112) function in [create-task.tsx](file:///d:/GraduationProject/FE/garapro-next-js/garapro-next-js/src/app/manager/repairOrderManagement/components/create-task.tsx) to:

- Provide a fallback name "Unknown Customer" when customer names are empty
- Ensure consistent name handling across the application

### 3. Ensured Proper Auto-Selection

Updated the customer creation flow to properly auto-select newly created customers by:

- Setting the [selectedCustomer](file:///d:/GraduationProject/FE/garapro-next-js/garapro-next-js/src/app/manager/repairOrderManagement/components/create-task.tsx#L32-L32) state with the newly created customer
- Updating the [customerSearch](file:///d:/GraduationProject/FE/garapro-next-js/garapro-next-js/src/app/manager/repairOrderManagement/components/create-task.tsx#L31-L31) field with the customer's name

## Verification

After applying these fixes:

1. Only one toast message appears when creating a new customer
2. The toast message shows the correct customer name
3. Newly created customers are automatically selected
4. No more "undefined undefined" customer names appear
5. The customer selection workflow works correctly
